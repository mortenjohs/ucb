### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Some of the tools we will use are Firefox add-ons. Ensure that you have the latest version of this popular web browser. [Download Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/), or if already installed, if necessary update to the latest version [following these instructions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version).

### [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)

For some exercises, you will need a text editor optimized for authoring web pages. These are both good options.

### [ggplot2 web app](http://rweb.stat.ucla.edu/ggplot2/)

Allows you to create charts through a point-and-click interface, unlocking the basic functionality of ggplot2, a visualization package for R (see below). Web app: no installation required.

### [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/)
Your go-to resource for color schemes to encode data. Web app: no installation required.

### [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/)
Allows you to simulate the effects of three forms of colorblindness on your screen, to check that your charts and maps do not exclude the color-impaired. [Download](http://colororacle.org/index.html) and move to your Applications folder. When launched, program icon will appear to the right of your menu bar. You can set to start at login under `Preferences`.

### [Tableau Public](http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/)
Visualization software designed for exploratory graphic analysis, which also allows you to create interactive online graphics without JavaScript coding. [Download here](http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/download). You will also need to [sign up](https://public.tableausoftware.com/auth/signup) for a free Tableau Public account.

The Public version of the software requires you to save your visualizations to the open web. However, members of Investigative Reporters and Editors can obtain a [license for the Professional version](https://www.ire.org/blog/ire-news/2013/06/20/tableau-makes-its-desktop-software-free-ire-member/), which allows you to save workbooks on your machine. In any case, I strongly recommend that J-School students [join IRE](http://www.ire.org/membership/apply/) as a student member: it is a leader for training in data journalism.

### [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

Point-and-click GUI for version control of your projects, and synching with remote hosting at [GitHub](https://github.com/). Download from [here](https://desktop.github.com/). You will also need to sign up [here](https://github.com/) for a free GitHub account.
