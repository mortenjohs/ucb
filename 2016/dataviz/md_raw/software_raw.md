### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Some of the tools we will use are Firefox add-ons. Ensure that you have the latest version of this popular web browser. [Download Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/), or if already installed, if necessary update to the latest version [following these instructions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version).

### [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)

For some exercises, you will need a text editor optimized for authoring web pages. These are both good options.

### [ggplot2 web app](http://rweb.stat.ucla.edu/ggplot2/)

Allows you to create charts through a point-and-click interface, unlocking the basic functionality of ggplot2, a visualization package for R (see below). Web app: no installation required.

### [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/)
Your go-to resource for color schemes to encode data. Web app: no installation required.

### [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/)
Allows you to simulate the effects of three forms of colorblindness on your screen, to check that your charts and maps do not exclude the color-impaired. [Download](http://colororacle.org/index.html) and move to your Applications folder. When launched, program icon will appear to the right of your menu bar. You can set to start at login under `Preferences`.

### [Tableau Public](http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/)
Visualization software designed for exploratory graphic analysis, which also allows you to create interactive online graphics without JavaScript coding.

The Public version of the software requires you to save your visualizations to the open web. However, members of Investigative Reporters and Editors can obtain a [license for the Professional version](https://www.ire.org/blog/ire-news/2013/06/20/tableau-makes-its-desktop-software-free-ire-member/), which allows you to save workbooks on your machine. In any case, I strongly recommend that J-School students [join IRE](http://www.ire.org/membership/apply/) as a student member: it is a leader for training in data journalism.
