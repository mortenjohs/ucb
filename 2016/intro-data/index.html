<h3 id="academic-dishonesty-and-plagiarism"><a name="academic-dishonesty-and-plagiarism" href="#academic-dishonesty-and-plagiarism"></a>Academic dishonesty and plagiarism</h3>
<p>The high academic standard at the University of California, Berkeley, is reflected in each degree that is awarded. As a result, it is up to every student to maintain this high standard by ensuring that all academic work reflects his/her own ideas or properly attributes the ideas to the original sources.</p>
<p>These are some basic expectations of students with regards to academic integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this course from this instructor.</p>
</li><li><p>All assignments must use “proper attribution,” meaning that you have identified the original source of words or ideas that you reproduce or use in your assignment. This includes drafts and homework assignments!</p>
</li><li><p>If you are unclear about expectations, ask your instructor.</p>
</li></ul>

If you are not currently listed with DSP (Disabled Students’ Program) but believe that you could benefit from their support, you may <a href="http://dsp.berkeley.edu/">apply online</a>.</p>
