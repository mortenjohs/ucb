We will cover fundamental principles of data analysis and visual presentation, chart types and when to use them, and how to acquire, process and “interview” data. We will make interactive and static charts and maps using free software. We will make graphics by writing code, as well as using point-and-click software. The emphasis is on gaining practical skills that students can apply in a newsroom setting.</p><p>You will also produce a substantial visualization project of your own. This will be your main opportunity to learn the problem-solving approach needed do this work in a newsroom. Do start discussing ideas with me as early as possible, and take advantage of my office hours so we can work through problems together!</p><h3 id="weekly-schedule"><a name="weekly-schedule" href="#weekly-schedule"></a>Weekly schedule</h3><p>We will meet in <strong>106/Upper NG</strong> on Fridays from 9.00am - 12.00noon.
